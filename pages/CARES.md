The Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education (CARES) was established in 2013 as the University of Cambridge’s first research centre outside the UK. It brings together researchers from the University of Cambridge, Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore to work on problems relevant to Singapore and the world at large.

CARES’ largest programme is the Cambridge Centre for Carbon Reduction in Chemical Technology, which commenced in 2013 when CARES opened. This is a collaborative effort involving researchers from University of Cambridge, Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore.

A further large programme began in October 2020 - the Centre for Lifelong Learning and Individualised Cognition (CLIC). CLIC brings together researchers from University of Cambridge and NTU to focus on the neuroscience of learning.

CARES is also hosting an Intra-CREATE project called Cities Knowledge Graph, a collaborative project between the University of Cambridge and the Singapore-ETH Centre. The project aims to harness rapidly growing and diversifying data streams to improve the planning and design of cities. 

CARES is a research partner in the Pharmaceutical Innovation Programme Singapore (PIPS), a public-private consortium that aims to develop full process automation in a laboratory to support R&D and manufacturing. 

The latest CARES-hosted project is AMPLE, a collaborative project between CARES and NTUitive, which has emerged from research in the C4T programme that aims to rapidly scale-up nanomaterial technologies for high quality and low cost.

The [Cambridge Centre for Carbon Reduction in Chemical Technology (C4T)](https://www.cares.cam.ac.uk/research/c4t-project/) represents a dynamic partnership between some of the world-leading scientists and engineers at the University of Cambridge, Nanyang Technological University and the National University of Singapore.

C4T answers the question of how to positively contribute to Singapore’s ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change while ensuring the country’s progress and prowess in economic, technological, environmental and social dimensions. C4T Phase 2, which began in November 2018, systematically investigates the raw materials, processes and products of the local chemical industry and investigates technologies to lower the carbon footprint of this major pillar of Singapore’s economy. The Phase 2 programme is designed to leverage the skilled human resource, cutting-edge scientific research and the vibrant enterprise demonstrated in Phase 1.
